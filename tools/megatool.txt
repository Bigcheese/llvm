llvm megatool:

Why?

* The current setup is lame.

Why?

* Takes a long time to link all those apps. Excpecailly on Windows where you
  have to statically link. Thus you pay for linking all of llvm in each one :(.
* The naming is inconsistent, as are the actual human interfaces.
* Statically linked they take up a large ammount of size, even though the actual
  driver code is a few hundred lines.
* They currentl'y are using names I want for my fools.

Well then what are you going to do about it. HUH!


* Merge all of the hacker tools into a single megatool. One tool to rule them all!
* Quite literally. The megatool will simply dispach to the tools as they
  currently are based on their name. Thus llvm-as becomes llvm as
* Simple as that!

How's it gonna get done.

* First, I leave everyhing as it is.
* I add the llvmmegatron2000 program and start reimplementing all of the tools
  we currently have. Meanwhile refactoring them to share code and use modern
  LLVM style.
* ***** we have a working llvm megetool *****
* Start converting all references too llvm-x with llvm x
* Once llvm-x tools have no dependencies... We murder them.
* ???
* profit
